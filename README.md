# Fantasy Adventure Game

## Introduction

This is a text-based fantasy adventure game implemented in Python. In this game, the player navigates through a dark and eerie dungeon filled with traps, monsters, and the ultimate challenge of defeating a dragon to rescue the princess.

## Player Class

The `Player` class represents the protagonist of the game. It contains attributes such as the player's name, health points, and flags indicating progress in the game (e.g., whether the player has rescued the princess or defeated the dragon). The class also includes methods for various actions the player can take, such as clearing traps, resting, encountering monsters, and fighting the dragon.

## Main Function


The `main` function serves as the entry point for the game. It initializes the player, provides an introduction to the game's storyline, and enters a loop where the player can choose actions to progress through the game. The loop continues until either the player rescues the princess, runs out of health points, or quits the game.

## How to Play
